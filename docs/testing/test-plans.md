## Quick Test Scenarios

### 1. Initialize User Context
```javascript
// First-time user setup
await llamaService.initializeUserContext();
const context = await healthDataManager.getUserContext();
console.log('Default context created:', context?.preferences);
```

### 2. Test Personalized Responses
```javascript
// Set user to prefer brief responses
await healthDataManager.updateUserContext({
  preferences: { responseLength: 'brief' }
});

// Ask a question - should get concise response
const response1 = await llamaService.generateHealthAdvice("How's my sleep?");

// Switch to detailed responses
await healthDataManager.updateUserContext({
  preferences: { responseLength: 'detailed' }
});

// Ask same question - should get comprehensive response
const response2 = await llamaService.generateHealthAdvice("How's my sleep?");
```

### 3. Test Learning & Adaptation
```javascript
// Simulate multiple sleep-related queries
await llamaService.generateHealthAdvice("I'm having trouble sleeping");
await llamaService.generateHealthAdvice("What's my sleep score?");
await llamaService.generateHealthAdvice("How can I sleep better?");

// Check if system learned to focus on sleep
const updatedContext = await healthDataManager.getUserContext();
console.log('Learned focus areas:', updatedContext?.preferences.focusAreas);
// Should now include 'sleep' in focus areas
```

### 4. Test Goal Progress Integration
```javascript
// Set some health goals
await healthDataManager.updateHealthGoals({
  sleep: { targetDuration: 480 }, // 8 hours
  fitness: { dailyCalorieTarget: 2200 }
});

// Get goal progress
const progress = await healthDataManager.getGoalProgress(7);
console.log('Sleep achievement:', progress?.sleep.achievement + '%');
console.log('Average calories burned:', progress?.calories.averageBurned);

// Ask for advice - should include goal context
const goalResponse = await llamaService.generateHealthAdvice("Give me health advice");
// Response should reference current progress and goals
```

### 5. Test Feedback Loop
```javascript
// Provide feedback that responses are too brief
await llamaService.adaptUserPreferences('too_brief');

// Check if preference was updated
const context = await healthDataManager.getUserContext();
console.log('Updated response length:', context?.preferences.responseLength);
// Should be 'moderate' or 'detailed' now
```

## Expected Behaviors

### Response Length Adaptation
- **Brief**: "You averaged 7.2h sleep (goal: 8h). Try earlier bedtime."
- **Moderate**: "Your sleep averaged 7.2 hours over the last week, which is slightly below your 8-hour goal. Consider setting a consistent bedtime 30 minutes earlier."
- **Detailed**: "Based on your week's data, you averaged 7.2 hours of sleep per night, falling short of your 8-hour target by 48 minutes daily. Your sleep efficiency has been good at 85%, but you'd benefit from..."

### Context Integration
- System remembers if user frequently asks about sleep, fitness, or stress
- Automatically includes relevant health data in responses
- References personal goals and progress in advice
- Adapts to user's lifestyle and health history

### Learning Patterns
- Tracks query times (morning vs evening questions)
- Identifies focus areas based on question frequency
- Adjusts response style based on user interaction patterns
- Builds personalized health insights over time

## Validation Tests

1. **Data Persistence**: Context should survive app restarts
2. **Pattern Recognition**: System should identify focus areas after 3+ related queries
3. **Goal Integration**: Responses should reference specific goals and progress
4. **Adaptive Length**: Response detail should match user preference
5. **Privacy**: All data should remain on-device only

## Debugging Commands

```javascript
// View current user context
const context = await healthDataManager.getUserContext();
console.log(JSON.stringify(context, null, 2));

// View recent goal progress
const progress = await healthDataManager.getGoalProgress();
console.log(JSON.stringify(progress, null, 2));

// Clear context for testing
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('userHealthContext');
```

## üéØ **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **1. Context Order Problem** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Session context was taking first 5 messages instead of most recent 5
**Fix**: Changed `slice(0, 5)` to `slice(-5)` to get recent messages

### **2. Poor Context Structure** ‚úÖ  
**Issue**: Conversation history wasn't clearly formatted for AI
**Fix**: Improved prompt structure with clear conversation history section

### **3. Limited Context Length** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Message context was truncated at 100 characters
**Fix**: Increased to 150 characters for better context

### **4. Missing Follow-up Instructions** ‚úÖ
**Issue**: AI wasn't explicitly told to consider previous context
**Fix**: Added clear instructions for handling follow-up questions

## üß™ **Test Follow-up Responses**

### **Test 1: Simple Follow-up Conversation**
1. **First message**: "What are good exercises for beginners?"
2. **Wait for response**
3. **Follow-up**: "How often should I do them?"
4. **Check**: AI should reference the exercises from previous response

### **Test 2: Health Topic Continuation**
1. **First**: "I'm having trouble sleeping"
2. **Wait for response**  
3. **Follow-up**: "What about if I also feel stressed?"
4. **Check**: AI should connect sleep and stress from previous context

### **Test 3: Diet Plan Follow-up**
1. **First**: "Give me a diet plan"
2. **Wait for response**
3. **Follow-up**: "What if I don't like fish?"
4. **Check**: AI should modify the diet plan considering your preference

### **Test 4: Multi-turn Context**
1. **First**: "I want to lose weight"
2. **Second**: "What exercises help with this?"
3. **Third**: "How about diet changes?"
4. **Fourth**: "Can you combine both into a plan?"
5. **Check**: Final response should integrate all previous context

## üîç **Debug Features Added**

### **Console Logs to Watch:**
- `üîÑ FOLLOW-UP CONTEXT DETECTED` - Shows when previous context is found
- `üÜï NEW CONVERSATION` - Shows when starting fresh
- `Session context length: X` - Shows how much context is available

### **What You Should See:**
‚úÖ **First question**: `üÜï NEW CONVERSATION`
‚úÖ **Follow-up questions**: `üîÑ FOLLOW-UP CONTEXT DETECTED`
‚úÖ **Context length > 0**: Shows conversation history is being passed

## üéØ **Expected Improvements**

### **Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Follow-up questions ignored previous context
- ‚ùå AI gave generic responses to specific follow-ups
- ‚ùå No conversation continuity
- ‚ùå Had to repeat context in every question

### **After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ **Context awareness**: AI remembers previous conversation
- ‚úÖ **Relevant responses**: Follow-ups build on previous answers
- ‚úÖ **Natural flow**: Conversation feels continuous
- ‚úÖ **Specific references**: AI can refer to previous topics
- ‚úÖ **Better advice**: Recommendations consider full conversation

## üìù **Technical Changes Made**

### **1. Session Context Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
recentMessages: session.messages.slice(0, 5) // First 5 messages

// AFTER (FIXED):
recentMessages: session.messages.slice(-5)  // Last 5 messages
```

### **2. Enhanced Context Format:**
```typescript
// BEFORE:
sessionContext = `Recent conversation context:
${recentMessages.map(m => `${m.author}: ${m.text}`).join('\n')}`;

// AFTER:
sessionContext = `Conversation History (most recent first):
${recentMessages.reverse().map(m => `${m.author === 'user' ? 'User' : 'Assistant'}: ${m.text}`).join('\n')}`;
```

### **3. Better Prompt Structure:**
```typescript
Current User Message: ${userInput}

Instructions: ${sessionContext ? 
  'Consider the conversation history above when crafting your response. If this appears to be a follow-up question, refer to the previous context appropriately.' : 
  'This is the start of a new conversation.'
} Respond naturally and helpfully.
```

## üéâ **Test Now!**

The app has been rebuilt with these improvements. Try having a multi-turn conversation:

1. **Ask about a health topic**
2. **Ask follow-up questions**
3. **Reference previous responses**
4. **Check if AI maintains context**

You should now see much better follow-up responses that actually reference and build upon previous conversation! üöÄ

## üìä **Quick Test Script**

Try this conversation flow:
```
You: "I want to improve my fitness"
AI: [gives fitness advice]

You: "What about my diet?"
AI: [should connect diet to fitness goals]

You: "Can you create a weekly plan?"
AI: [should create plan considering both fitness and diet from above]
```

The AI should now maintain context throughout the conversation! üí™
