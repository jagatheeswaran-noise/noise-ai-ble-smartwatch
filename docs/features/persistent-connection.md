# Persistent Connection State Implementation

## Overview
The persistent connection state feature allows the smartwatch app to remember connected devices and automatically reconnect when the app is restarted, providing a seamless user experience similar to native smartwatch apps.

## Architecture

### 1. ConnectionPersistenceService (`src/services/ConnectionPersistenceService.ts`)
This service handles all persistent storage operations for connection state:

- **Storage**: Uses React Native AsyncStorage for cross-app-session persistence
- **Data Stored**: Device information (MAC address, name, etc.) and binding status
- **Methods**:
  - `saveConnectionState()`: Saves device info when successfully connected
  - `getDeviceForReconnect()`: Retrieves saved device for auto-reconnection
  - `clearConnectionState()`: Removes saved connection (for "forget device")

### 2. Enhanced ZHSDKService (`src/services/ZHSDKService.ts`)
The main BLE service now includes persistence and auto-reconnection capabilities:

#### New Features Added:
- **Auto-reconnection logic**: Attempts to reconnect to the last device on app start
- **Connection state persistence**: Automatically saves device info when binding succeeds
- **Reconnection management**: Handles failed attempts with retry logic and cleanup

#### Key Methods:
- `initializeWithPersistence()`: Main entry point that checks for saved devices and attempts reconnection
- `attemptAutoReconnect()`: Handles the actual reconnection process
- `reconnectToLastDevice()`: Manual reconnection trigger
- `clearConnectionPersistence()`: Clears saved connection state

### 3. UI Integration (`src/components/smartwatch/`)

#### SmartwatchManager.tsx
- Calls `initializeWithPersistence()` on component mount
- Automatically switches to device control view if reconnection succeeds

#### DeviceControl.tsx
- Added "Reconnect" button for manual reconnection attempts
- Added "Forget Device" button to clear persistent connection state
- Enhanced status display with real-time connection information

## How It Works

### 1. Initial Connection & Binding
1. User scans and connects to a smartwatch normally
2. Once binding completes successfully, the device info is automatically saved to AsyncStorage
3. The app remembers this device for future sessions

### 2. App Restart & Auto-Reconnection
1. When the app starts, `SmartwatchManager` calls `initializeWithPersistence()`
2. The service checks if there's a saved device in AsyncStorage
3. If found, it attempts to reconnect automatically:
   - Verifies SDK status and permissions
   - Attempts connection to the saved device
   - Updates UI state if successful
   - Clears saved state if max retry attempts exceeded

### 3. Manual Control
Users can:
- **Reconnect**: Manually trigger reconnection using the "Reconnect" button
- **Forget Device**: Clear the saved connection using "Forget Device" button
- **Check Status**: View real-time connection status and device information

## Configuration

### Auto-Reconnection Settings
```typescript
private autoReconnectEnabled: boolean = true;
private reconnectAttempts: number = 0;
private maxReconnectAttempts: number = 3;
```

### Storage Keys
```typescript
private static readonly STORAGE_KEYS = {
  CONNECTED_DEVICE: 'zhsdk_connected_device',
  CONNECTION_STATE: 'zhsdk_connection_state',
  LAST_BIND_SUCCESS: 'zhsdk_last_bind_success'
};
```

## Event Flow

### On Successful Binding:
1. `onBindingSuccess` event fired
2. Device info automatically saved to AsyncStorage
3. Connection status updated in UI

### On App Start:
1. `initializeWithPersistence()` called
2. Checks for saved device
3. Attempts auto-reconnection if device found
4. UI updated based on connection result

### On Connection Loss:
1. Connection state events update UI
2. Saved device info remains for future reconnection
3. Auto-reconnection can be triggered manually

## Benefits

1. **Seamless User Experience**: App behaves like native smartwatch apps
2. **Automatic Reconnection**: No need to re-pair after app restarts
3. **Manual Control**: Users can manage connections as needed
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures
5. **Privacy Control**: Users can "forget" devices when needed

## Testing

To test the persistent connection feature:

1. **Initial Setup**: Connect and bind to a smartwatch
2. **Force Close**: Kill the app completely
3. **Restart**: Open the app again
4. **Verify**: App should automatically reconnect and show "Connected & Bound" status
5. **Manual Control**: Test "Reconnect" and "Forget Device" buttons

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Permissions**: Ensure Bluetooth and Location permissions are granted
- **Device State**: Make sure the smartwatch is powered on and in range
- **SDK Status**: Verify the ZH SDK is properly initialized

### Debugging:
The implementation includes comprehensive logging with prefixed emojis:
